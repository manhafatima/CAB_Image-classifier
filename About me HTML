      <p>
        <u><b>KWK Fall Scholar:</b></u> I was able to be a part of Kode with
        klossy's (KWK) Fall Code-A-Bration (CAB). In this program, I had the
        chance to learn more about the field of AI/Ml, and create my own image
        classifier using Teachable Machine.
      </p>

      <p>
        <u><b>GWC Summer Pathways Scholar:</b></u> I was a part of Girls Who
        Code (GWC) Summer Pathways program. This was a six-week program that
        introduced me to the world of web development. I learned beginner HTML
        and CSS, and was able to build my own portfolio website.
      </p>

      <p>
        <u><b>Intro to programming with Python (CodeHS):</b></u>
        I have been able to take a CodeHS python course in my highschool, and
        learnt ALOT about programming concepts and ways to write more efficient
        and cleaner code! I learned about various data structures in Python,
        such as lists, tuples, dicts, etc. I was also introduced to Turtle
        graphics in this class, and built various designs with it.
